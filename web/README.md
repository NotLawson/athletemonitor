# Client

The client will be a Single Page Progressive Web App, which will allow it to be installed on mobile devices while still using web-based distribution.

These PWAs require a manifest file and a service worker for idle function, such as notification delivery.

Staff and Admin endpoints will not be part of the Single Page WAPP, but will be accessible from the Progressive Web App.
